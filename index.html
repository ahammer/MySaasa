<p>MySaasa has been a bewilderment I've carried with me for many years. It started somewhere around the .com bubble, and continues to this day. I could never understand how all these SaaS and white label branding companies got their architectures so dreadfully wrong. Seeing how the anti-patterns in the code were directly reflected in the architectures of the companies that created them.</p>

<p>Development started some time around 2012-2013, I had already been thinking about the problem for about 10 years, I had been building games at the time, I wanted something bigger, and wanted to focus on my strengths. So I switched over to this and decided early on I was going to drop at least 2 years on it. 3 years, 1000+ tickets, 100+ iterations later and I feel like I may have built something.</p>
