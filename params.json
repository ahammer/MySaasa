It started somewhere around the .com bubble, and continues to this day. I could never understand how all these SaaS and white label branding companies got their architectures so dreadfully wrong. Seeing how the anti-patterns in the code were directly reflected in the architectures of the companies that created them.\r\n\r\nDevelopment started some time around 2012-2013, I had already been thinking about the problem for about 10 years, I had been building games at the time, I wanted something bigger, and wanted to focus on my strengths. So I switched over to this and decided early on I was going to drop at least 2 years on it. 3 years, 1000+ tickets, 100+ iterations later and I feel like I may have built something.\r\n\r\n[Adam Hammer](http://www.adamhammer.ca) \r\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-hammer-4b605530) \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nContact Adam Hammer for support options.",
